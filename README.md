Welcome to my capstone project: Data Science Job Locator for 2024!

Aim of capstone: construct a machine learning model that is able to classify which economic region is best to apply to for data science professionals in 2024 based on input salary range and perceived competitiveness

Data Sources(in data folder):
1.) Kaggle Dataset Containing 500 job posts from Glassdoor for Data Science Professionals in 2024
2.) BLS report on Data Science Employment Statistics across the US in 2023

Project Summary and Workflow:
1.) Data_Wrangling - format, tidy, and merge the data from the two data sources via pandas
2.) Exploratory_Data_Analysis - provide visualizations of the different characteristics contained within the dataframe via pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn
3.) Preprocessing - construct a python object that will be able to input a dataframe and output a set of training and test data, while providing any necessary transformations/scaling via pandas and sklearn
4.) Modeling - utilize the data to train Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network classification models and hyperparameter tune the models accordingly via sklearn and tensorflow
5.) Final_Report_and_Presentaiton - documentation containing the findings of the project and the steps for the next iterations

Thank you for taking the time to read this! And I hope you find the model useful!
